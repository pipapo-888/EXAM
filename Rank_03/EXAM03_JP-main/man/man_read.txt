PROLOG
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface may
       differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may  not
       be implemented on Linux.

NAME
       pread, read — read from a file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       ssize_t pread(int fildes, void *buf, size_t nbyte, off_t offset);
       ssize_t read(int fildes, void *buf, size_t nbyte);

DESCRIPTION
       The read() function shall attempt to read nbyte bytes from the file associated with the open file descriptor,
       fildes, into the buffer pointed to by buf.  The behavior of multiple concurrent reads on the same pipe, FIFO,
       or terminal device is unspecified.

       Before  any  action described below is taken, and if nbyte is zero, the read() function may detect and return
       errors as described below. In the absence of errors, or if error detection is not performed, the read() func‐
       tion shall return zero and have no other results.

       On files that support seeking (for example, a regular file), the read() shall start at a position in the file
       given by the file offset associated with fildes.  The file offset shall be incremented by the number of bytes
       actually read.

       Files  that do not support seeking—for example, terminals—always read from the current position. The value of
       a file offset associated with such a file is undefined.

       No data transfer shall occur past the current end-of-file. If the starting position is at or after  the  end-
       of-file,  0  shall be returned.  If the file refers to a device special file, the result of subsequent read()
       requests is implementation-defined.

       If the value of nbyte is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is implementation-defined.

       When attempting to read from an empty pipe or FIFO:

        *  If no process has the pipe open for writing, read() shall return 0 to indicate end-of-file.

        *  If some process has the pipe open for writing and O_NONBLOCK is set, read() shall return -1 and set errno
           to [EAGAIN].

        *  If  some  process  has  the pipe open for writing and O_NONBLOCK is clear, read() shall block the calling
           thread until some data is written or the pipe is closed by all processes that had the pipe open for writ‐
           ing.

       When  attempting  to read a file (other than a pipe or FIFO) that supports non-blocking reads and has no data
       currently available:

        *  If O_NONBLOCK is set, read() shall return -1 and set errno to [EAGAIN].

        *  If O_NONBLOCK is clear, read() shall block the calling thread until some data becomes available.

        *  The use of the O_NONBLOCK flag has no effect if there is some data available.

       The read() function reads data previously written to a file. If any portion of a regular file  prior  to  the
       end-of-file  has  not  been  written, read() shall return bytes with value 0. For example, lseek() allows the
       file offset to be set beyond the end of existing data in the file. If data is later written  at  this  point,
       subsequent  reads  in  the gap between the previous end of data and the newly written data shall return bytes
       with value 0 until data is written into the gap.

       Upon successful completion, where nbyte is greater than 0, read() shall mark for update the last data  access
       timestamp  of  the  file, and shall return the number of bytes read.  This number shall never be greater than
       nbyte.  The value returned may be less than nbyte if the number of bytes left in the file is less than nbyte,
       if  the  read() request was interrupted by a signal, or if the file is a pipe or FIFO or special file and has
       fewer than nbyte bytes immediately available for reading. For example, a read() from a file associated with a
       terminal may return one typed line of data.

       If  a  read()  is  interrupted  by  a  signal  before it reads any data, it shall return -1 with errno set to
       [EINTR].

       If a read() is interrupted by a signal after it has successfully read some data, it shall return  the  number
       of bytes read.

       For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset maximum established in the open file descrip‐
       tion associated with fildes.

       If fildes refers to a socket, read() shall be equivalent to recv() with no flags set.

       If the O_DSYNC and O_RSYNC bits have been set, read I/O operations on the file descriptor shall  complete  as
       defined by synchronized I/O data integrity completion. If the O_SYNC and O_RSYNC bits have been set, read I/O
       operations on the file descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O file integrity completion.

       If fildes refers to a shared memory object, the result of the read() function is unspecified.

       If fildes refers to a typed memory object, the result of the read() function is unspecified.

       A read() from a STREAMS file can read data in three different  modes:  byte-stream  mode,  message-nondiscard
       mode,  and  message-discard mode. The default shall be byte-stream mode.  This can be changed using the I_SR‐
       DOPT ioctl() request, and can be tested with I_GRDOPT ioctl().  In byte-stream mode,  read()  shall  retrieve
       data from the STREAM until as many bytes as were requested are transferred, or until there is no more data to
       be retrieved.  Byte-stream mode ignores message boundaries.

       In STREAMS message-nondiscard mode, read() shall retrieve data until as many  bytes  as  were  requested  are
       transferred,  or  until a message boundary is reached. If read() does not retrieve all the data in a message,
       the remaining data shall be left on the STREAM, and can be retrieved by the next read() call. Message-discard
       mode  also  retrieves  data  until  as many bytes as were requested are transferred, or a message boundary is
       reached.  However, unread data remaining in a message after the read() returns shall be discarded, and  shall
       not be available for a subsequent read(), getmsg(), or getpmsg() call.

       How  read() handles zero-byte STREAMS messages is determined by the current read mode setting. In byte-stream
       mode, read() shall accept data until it has read nbyte bytes, or until there is no more data to read, or  un‐
       til a zero-byte message block is encountered. The read() function shall then return the number of bytes read,
       and place the zero-byte message back on the  STREAM  to  be  retrieved  by  the  next  read(),  getmsg(),  or
       getpmsg().   In  message-nondiscard  mode or message-discard mode, a zero-byte message shall return 0 and the
       message shall be removed from the STREAM. When a zero-byte message is read as the first message on a  STREAM,
       the message shall be removed from the STREAM and 0 shall be returned, regardless of the read mode.

       A read() from a STREAMS file shall return the data in the message at the front of the STREAM head read queue,
       regardless of the priority band of the message.

       By default, STREAMs are in control-normal mode, in which a read() from a STREAMS file can only  process  mes‐
       sages that contain a data part but do not contain a control part. The read() shall fail if a message contain‐
       ing a control part is encountered at the STREAM head. This default action  can  be  changed  by  placing  the
       STREAM in either control-data mode or control-discard mode with the I_SRDOPT ioctl() command. In control-data
       mode, read() shall convert any control part to data and pass it to the application before  passing  any  data
       part  originally  present in the same message.  In control-discard mode, read() shall discard message control
       parts but return to the process any data part in the message.

       In addition, read() shall fail if the STREAM head had processed an asynchronous error  before  the  call.  In
       this  case,  the  value  of  errno  shall not reflect the result of read(), but reflect the prior error. If a
       hangup occurs on the STREAM being read, read() shall continue to operate normally until the STREAM head  read
       queue is empty. Thereafter, it shall return 0.

       The  pread()  function  shall be equivalent to read(), except that it shall read from a given position in the
       file without changing the file offset. The first three arguments to pread() are the same as read()  with  the
       addition  of  a  fourth  argument  offset  for  the desired position inside the file. An attempt to perform a
       pread() on a file that is incapable of seeking shall result in an error.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a non-negative  integer  indicating  the  number  of
       bytes actually read. Otherwise, the functions shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       These functions shall fail if:

       EAGAIN The file is neither a pipe, nor a FIFO, nor a socket, the O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descrip‐
              tor, and the thread would be delayed in the read operation.

       EBADF  The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor open for reading.

       EBADMSG
              The file is a STREAM file that is set to control-normal mode and the message waiting to  be  read  in‐
              cludes a control part.

       EINTR  The read operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and no data was transferred.

       EINVAL The  STREAM  or  multiplexer referenced by fildes is linked (directly or indirectly) downstream from a
              multiplexer.

       EIO    The process is a member of a background process group attempting to read from its  controlling  termi‐
              nal,  and  either  the  calling  thread  is blocking SIGTTIN or the process is ignoring SIGTTIN or the
              process group of the process is orphaned. This error may also be generated for  implementation-defined
              reasons.

       EISDIR The  fildes  argument  refers to a directory and the implementation does not allow the directory to be
              read using read() or pread().  The readdir() function should be used instead.

       EOVERFLOW
              The file is a regular file, nbyte is greater than 0, the starting position is before the  end-of-file,
              and  the starting position is greater than or equal to the offset maximum established in the open file
              description associated with fildes.

       The pread() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The file is a regular file or block special file, and the offset argument is negative. The file offset
              shall remain unchanged.

       ESPIPE The file is incapable of seeking.

       The read() function shall fail if:

       EAGAIN The  file  is a pipe or FIFO, the O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor, and the thread would
              be delayed in the read operation.

       EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
              The file is a socket, the O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor, and the thread would be  de‐
              layed in the read operation.

       ECONNRESET
              A read was attempted on a socket and the connection was forcibly closed by its peer.

       ENOTCONN
              A read was attempted on a socket that is not connected.

       ETIMEDOUT
              A read was attempted on a socket and a transmission timeout occurred.

       These functions may fail if:

       EIO    A physical I/O error has occurred.

       ENOBUFS
              Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the operation.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.

       ENXIO  A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside the capabilities of the device.

       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
   Reading Data into a Buffer
       The following example reads data from the file associated with the file descriptor fd into the buffer pointed
       to by buf.

           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <unistd.h>
           ...
           char buf[20];
           size_t nbytes;
           ssize_t bytes_read;
           int fd;
           ...
           nbytes = sizeof(buf);
           bytes_read = read(fd, buf, nbytes);
           ...

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

RATIONALE
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify the value of the file offset after an error is  returned;  there
       are  too many cases. For programming errors, such as [EBADF], the concept is meaningless since no file is in‐
       volved. For errors that are detected immediately, such as [EAGAIN], clearly the offset should not change. Af‐
       ter  an  interrupt  or  hardware error, however, an updated value would be very useful and is the behavior of
       many implementations.

       Note that a read() of zero bytes does not modify the last data access timestamp. A read() that requests  more
       than zero bytes, but returns zero, is required to modify the last data access timestamp.

       Implementations are allowed, but not required, to perform error checking for read() requests of zero bytes.

   Input and Output
       The use of I/O with large byte counts has always presented problems.  Ideas such as lread() and lwrite() (us‐
       ing and returning longs) were considered at one time. The current solution is to use abstract  types  on  the
       ISO C standard function to read() and write().  The abstract types can be declared so that existing functions
       work, but can also be declared so that larger types can be represented in future implementations. It is  pre‐
       sumed  that  whatever  constraints  limit the maximum range of size_t also limit portable I/O requests to the
       same range. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 also limits the range further by requiring that  the  byte  count  be
       limited  so  that a signed return value remains meaningful. Since the return type is also a (signed) abstract
       type, the byte count can be defined by the implementation to be larger than an int can hold.

       The standard developers considered adding atomicity requirements to a pipe or FIFO, but recognized  that  due
       to the nature of pipes and FIFOs there could be no guarantee of atomicity of reads of {PIPE_BUF} or any other
       size that would be an aid to applications portability.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that no action be taken for read() or write() when nbyte is  zero.  This
       is not intended to take precedence over detection of errors (such as invalid buffer pointers or file descrip‐
       tors). This is consistent with the rest of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, but the phrasing here could  be  mis‐
       read  to  require  detection of the zero case before any other errors.  A value of zero is to be considered a
       correct value, for which the semantics are a no-op.

       I/O is intended to be atomic to ordinary files and pipes and FIFOs.  Atomic means that all the bytes  from  a
       single  operation  that started out together end up together, without interleaving from other I/O operations.
       It is a known attribute of terminals that this is not honored, and terminals are explicitly  (and  implicitly
       permanently)  excepted, making the behavior unspecified. The behavior for other device types is also left un‐
       specified, but the wording is intended to imply that future standards might choose to specify  atomicity  (or
       not).

       There were recommendations to add format parameters to read() and write() in order to handle networked trans‐
       fers among heterogeneous file system and base hardware types. Such a facility may be required for support  by
       the  OSI  presentation of layer services. However, it was determined that this should correspond with similar
       C-language facilities, and that is beyond the scope of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. The concept was suggested
       to the developers of the ISO C standard for their consideration as a possible area for future work.

       In  4.3 BSD, a read() or write() that is interrupted by a signal before transferring any data does not by de‐
       fault return an [EINTR] error, but is restarted. In 4.2 BSD, 4.3 BSD, and the Eighth Edition, there is an ad‐
       ditional  function,  select(),  whose  purpose  is  to pause until specified activity (data to read, space to
       write, and so on) is detected on specified file descriptors. It is common in applications written  for  those
       systems  for  select()  to be used before read() in situations (such as keyboard input) where interruption of
       I/O due to a signal is desired.

       The issue of which files or file types are interruptible is considered an implementation design  issue.  This
       is often affected primarily by hardware and reliability issues.

       There  are  no  references to actions taken following an ``unrecoverable error''. It is considered beyond the
       scope of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 to describe what happens in the case of hardware errors.

       Earlier versions of this standard allowed two very different behaviors with regard to the handling of  inter‐
       rupts. In order to minimize the resulting confusion, it was decided that POSIX.1‐2008 should support only one
       of these behaviors. Historical practice on AT&T-derived systems was to have read() and write() return -1  and
       set  errno  to  [EINTR] when interrupted after some, but not all, of the data requested had been transferred.
       However, the US Department of Commerce FIPS 151‐1 and FIPS 151‐2 require  the  historical  BSD  behavior,  in
       which  read() and write() return the number of bytes actually transferred before the interrupt.  If -1 is re‐
       turned when any data is transferred, it is difficult to recover from the error on a seekable device  and  im‐
       possible  on a non-seekable device. Most new implementations support this behavior.  The behavior required by
       POSIX.1‐2008 is to return the number of bytes transferred.

       POSIX.1‐2008 does not specify when an implementation that buffers read()s actually moves the  data  into  the
       user-supplied  buffer,  so an implementation may choose to do this at the latest possible moment.  Therefore,
       an interrupt arriving earlier may not cause read() to return a partial byte count, but rather  to  return  -1
       and set errno to [EINTR].

       Consideration  was  also  given to combining the two previous options, and setting errno to [EINTR] while re‐
       turning a short count. However, not only is there no existing practice that implements this, it is also  con‐
       tradictory to the idea that when errno is set, the function responsible shall return -1.

       This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017 intentionally does not specify any pread() errors related to pipes, FIFOs, and
       sockets other than [ESPIPE].

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
